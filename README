This repo contains Voodoo sound kernel patches

How to apply those patches or keep your kernel up-to-date.


When using git for your kernel:

	apply-or-update-patches.sh \
		-m git \
		-s gt-i9000-froyo-jpx-or-your-model \
		-d your/kernel/tree



When not using git for your kernel:
	- I invite you to try it; really worth it ;)

	apply-or-update-patches.sh \
		-m patch \
		-s gt-i9000-froyo-jpx-or-your-model \
		-d your/kernel/tree


Once you have a running kernel, you get new sysfs controls available not only
to Voodo App, but to any software running on the phone, without requiring
root permissions for standard usage.
